%campaign.name is unsuccsessful.

Sometimes no matter how hard we work on these campaigns, they just don't make it to 100%. But know that you're always welcome to reanalyze and recraft your ideas into a new campaign.

Because %site.name is an all or nothing campaign, the money will not be collected from the contributors, and you have no obligation to complete any of the promises you made on your campaign page.

Even though you didn't meet your goal, we hope it doesn't stop you from bringing this idea into the world at some other time. Keep on making this world a better place.
